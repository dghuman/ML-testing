# ML-testing
Personal Repo for Learning and testing ML programs. In particular tensorflow and keras.

## DataSetGen
Contains the script DataGen_2DRand.py which is the script for generating the training and test data sets. The generated data is in the form of 2D numpy arrays.

## tools
Useful python functions. Currently just a timer is here.

## ML_2DRand.py
Script that takes training data, converts it to a tensorflow tensor which can be trained on, and then trains a model saving it to fit_models.

## model_testing.py
Script I run interactively ``python3 -i model_testing.py`` to load in model and play around with.

## plot.py
Displays plot of training history for model.
